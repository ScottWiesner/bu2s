# bu2s

BU2S is a forward-time, mutation-based, infinite-sites, individual-based, stochastic population genetic simulator.
It includes mutation, selection, migration, recombination, and drift.

System Requirements for compiling and running:
- a Linux/UNIX-style terminal or terminal emulator
- a C compiler (gcc is the default in the Makefile)
- make

To use:
(1) Download the "Source" directory
(2) In a Linux/UNIX terminal type the following (not the dollar signs; those represent the prompt):
    $ cd Source
    $ make clean
    $ make

The executable generated by make ("bu2s") can then be run with the command:
    $ ./bu2s

A list of command line options and their explanations can be obtained with the command:
    $ ./bu2s -?
